While I am doing work on my computer and phone, I try to be aware of what is going on in the outside world.
For instance, listening to music to make sure that nothing disturbs me while sleeping is a good reason to wear
headphones if you are living in a dorm, but in the mean time, it is dangerous. I have been thinking that
a software that warns me when a noise that is extra ordinary is heard would be a great. And this
software should also be capable of receiving data from IoT devices so that when my computer's mic is not in range
to hear the noise those device can help.

In home, to not disturb my family, I choose to work at night. During that time, I am
also able to use my headphone because otherwise I cannot hear when someone calls me out.

How this software will carry its task is simple. It will work in the background and there will a be
indicator that the current state of the outside world is O.K. When that indicator changes in a way that
it warns there is something unusual happening, I can gladly plug off my earphone and check the things out.

I think that for Linux, I can develop a GNOME Shell extension and for KDE as well. For other platforms
the popularity of the software will help to decide whether the software should be ported.

At the time of writing, I have a bit of experience with Qt framework, but for I find GTK3 more stable over
Qt, it will be my first choice (And I am using Ubuntu 18.10 so it also puts some weight).
