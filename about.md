I have been developing software since 2010. I have recently started doing it professionally. I am interested in Artificial
Intelligence technologies and want to start a project called 'Ubermench'.

There are some projects that I currently maintain and I want to add some new ones to them. I am always open to work
with a team and people, so currently searching projects to join.

I want to shape my working environment based on the future projects I am planning to initiate, but currently
in the decision making process.

Reach me if this post interests you in a way we can discuss your thoughts.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely
