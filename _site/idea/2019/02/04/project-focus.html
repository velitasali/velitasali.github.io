    <p>While I am doing work on my computer and phone, I try to be aware of what is going on in the outside world.
For instance, listening to music to make sure that nothing disturbs me while sleeping is a good reason to wear
headphones if you are living in a dorm, but in the mean time, it is dangerous. I have been thinking that
a software that warns me when a noise that is extra ordinary is heard would be a great. And this
software should also be capable of receiving data from IoT devices so that when my computerâ€™s mic is not in range
to hear the noise those device can help.</p>

<p>In home, to not disturb my family, I choose to work at night. During that time, I am
also able to use my headphone because otherwise I cannot hear when someone calls me out.</p>

<p>How this software will carry its task is simple. It will work in the background and there will a be
indicator that the current state of the outside world is O.K. When that indicator changes in a way that
it warns there is something unusual happening, I can gladly plug off my earphone and check the things out.</p>

<p>I think that for Linux, I can develop a GNOME Shell extension and for KDE as well. For other platforms
the popularity of the software will help to decide whether the software should be ported.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, I have a bit of experience with Qt framework, but for I find GTK3 more stable over
Qt, it will be my first choice (And I am using Ubuntu 18.10 so it also puts some weight).</p>
